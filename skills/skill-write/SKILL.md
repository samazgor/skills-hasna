# Article Writer Skill

This skill spawns parallel AI agents to research and write articles on any topic. Each article goes through a multi-phase pipeline:

This CLI is API-backed. Set `SKILL_API_KEY` when routing through the hosted skills/connectors runtime; provider-specific keys are managed by that runtime.

1. **Research Agent** - Gathers information and key points about the topic
2. **Writer Agent** - Creates a well-structured article based on the research
3. **Image Agent** (optional) - Generates a cover image for the article

## Features

- Write single articles or batch process multiple topics
- Configurable writing styles (blog, technical, news, academic, casual)
- Adjustable article lengths (short, medium, long)
- Optional cover image generation (OpenAI DALL-E, Google Imagen, xAI Aurora)
- Parallel processing for batch operations
- Markdown output with YAML frontmatter
- Automatic directory creation

## Usage

### Write a Single Article
```bash
bun run src/index.ts write \
  --topic "The Future of AI in Healthcare" \
  --style technical \
  --length long \
  --output ./articles \
  --image
```

### Batch Write Multiple Articles
```bash
bun run src/index.ts batch \
  --topics "Machine Learning" "Cloud Computing" "Cybersecurity" \
  --style blog \
  --output ./articles \
  --parallel 5 \
  --image
```

## Configuration

Set the hosted runtime API key:

```bash
export SKILL_API_KEY=your_skill_api_key
```

## Output Format

Articles are saved as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:
```markdown
